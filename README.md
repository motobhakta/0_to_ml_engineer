# 0 to ML Engineer

I will put materials and coursework here that I'm using to teach myself machine
learning. Eventually I'm hoping to use this knowledge to get a job doing machine
learning!

I have already brushed up on Linear Algebra, Probability, and Calculus before I
started learning the following materials. All three of these topics are
important in machine learning.

## Skills

The list of skills I hope to learn are largely influenced by the skills
needed to acquire a job doing machine learning.

The most detailed job posting I've seen on this was for a lead data scientist
position that was posted by the Government of Ontario (located [here](lead_data_scientist_job_posting.pdf)).

I have roughly created my coursework based on the skills listed in this job posting.

## Courses

Introduction:

- [x] 1. Udacity: Intro to Data Analysis
- [x] 2. Udacity: Intro to Machine Learning

The Meat:

- [ ] 3. Coursera: Machine Learning

### 1. Udacity: Intro To Data Analysis

https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-analysis--ud170

folder: [intro\_to\_data_analysis/](intro_to_data_analysis/)

review: A nice intro to the numpy and pandas libraries for python.

### 2. Udacity: Intro to Machine Learning

https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120

folder: [intro\_to\_machine_learning](intro_to_machine_learning/)

review: This was an excellent course for a beginner to machine learning. It gently
introduces you to the general process of machine learning (data probing, feature selection,
algo selection, evaluation), while keeping the level of math to a minimum. 


### 3. Udacity: Machine Learning For Trading

https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-for-trading--ud501

folder: [machine\_learning\_for_trading](machine_learning_for_trading/)

review: #TODO
