# 0 to ML Engineer

I will put materials and coursework here that I'm using to teach myself machine
learning. Eventually I'm hoping to use this knowledge to get a job doing machine
learning!

I've already brushed up on Linear Algebra, Probability, and Calculus before I
started learning the following materials. All three of these topics are fairly
important in machine learning.

## Skills

The list of skills I hope to learn are largely influenced by the skills
needed to acquire a job doing machine learning.

The most detailed job posting I've seen on this was for a lead data scientist
position that was posted by the Government of Ontario (located [here](lead_data_scientist_job_posting.pdf)).

I have roughly created my coursework based on the skills listed in this job posting.
