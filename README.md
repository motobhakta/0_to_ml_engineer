# 0 to ML Engineer

I will put materials and coursework here that I'm using to teach myself machine
learning. Eventually I'm hoping to use this knowledge to get a job doing machine
learning!

I have already brushed up on Linear Algebra, Probability, and Calculus before I
started learning the following materials. All three of these topics are
important in machine learning.

## Skills

The list of skills I hope to learn are largely influenced by the skills
needed to acquire a job doing machine learning.

The most detailed job posting I've seen on this was for a lead data scientist
position that was posted by the Government of Ontario (located [here](lead_data_scientist_job_posting.pdf)).

I have roughly created my coursework based on the skills listed in this job posting.

- large scale distributed data acquisition
- data cleaning & normalization
- data storage
- information extraction
- RESTful APIs
- data authentication
- data visualization
- design and build machine learning infrastructure including model training and
serving API requests
- Elasticsearch data storage
- HBase
- Kafka
- Tesserect

### 1. Udacity: Intro To Data Analysis

https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-analysis--ud170

folder: [intro\_to\_data_analysis/](intro_to_data_analysis/)

review: A nice intro to the numpy and pandas libraries for python.

### 2. Udacity: Intro to Machine Learning

https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120

folder: [intro\_to\_machine_learning](intro_to_machine_learning/)

review: This was an excellent course for a beginner to machine learning. It gently
introduces you to the general process of machine learning (data probing, feature selection,
algo selection, evaluation), while keeping the level of math to a minimum.


### 3. Udacity: Machine Learning For Trading

https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-for-trading--ud501

folder: N/A

review: I didn't actually do this course because it was so bad. There was no coding
exercises, and depth of the material was very shallow, so I passed on it.

time taken: N/A

### 4. Udacity: Deep Learning from Google

https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730

folder: [deep_learning](deep_learning/)

review: I found it was much easier to get information on neural networks through
blog posts and reading tensorflow documentation. I completed the course, but
some of the questions and exercises weren't structured very well. YMMV

### 5. Udacity: Intro to Hadoop and Mapreduce

https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-hadoop-and-mapreduce--ud617

folder: N/A

review: The course had an excellent structure and the concepts were logically
ordered. I think I completed this in half a day. It was very nice to finally
understand hadoop.
