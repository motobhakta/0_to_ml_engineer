# Project Overview
In this project, you will play detective, and put your machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

# Why this Project?
This project will teach you the end-to-end process of investigating data through a machine learning lens.

It will teach you how to extract/identify useful features that best represents your data, a few of the most commonly used machine learning algorithms today, and how to evaluate the performance of your machine learning algorithms.

# What will I learn?
By the end of the project, you will be able to:

- Deal with an imperfect, real-world dataset
- Validate a machine learning result using test data
- Evaluate a machine learning result using quantitative metrics
- Create, select and transform features compare the performance of machine learning algorithms
- Tune machine learning algorithms for maximum performance
- Communicate your machine learning algorithm results clearly

# Features

financial features: ['salary', 'deferral_payments', 'total_payments', 'loan_advances', 'bonus', 'restricted_stock_deferred', 'deferred_income', 'total_stock_value', 'expenses', 'exercised_stock_options', 'other', 'long_term_incentive', 'restricted_stock', 'director_fees'] (all units are in US dollars)

email features: ['to_messages', 'email_address', 'from_poi_to_this_person', 'from_messages', 'from_this_person_to_poi', 'shared_receipt_with_poi'] (units are generally number of emails messages; notable exception is ‘email_address’, which is a text string)

POI label: [‘poi’] (boolean, represented as integer)
