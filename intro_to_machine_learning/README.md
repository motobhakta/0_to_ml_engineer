## ML Process:

1. Data Analysis: investigate your data; define a question; find the data that could help you
answer it.
2. Feature Selection: finding the right feature spaces for your algorithm.
3. Algo Selection: find the right algorithm to use and the right parameter tunes.
4. Validation: make sure your analysis is trustworthy.
